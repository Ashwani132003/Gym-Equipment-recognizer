# Gym-Equipment-recognizer

This repo contains a model that predicts/recognizes the name of equipmwnt from looking at the images of different gym equipments.
CNN Model is used here (in Pytorch).
Dataset used for building this model is collected by me from various sources and at the time of creating this repo, it only contains dataset of 4 gym equipments.
I am hoping to add more data later on, and I welcome anyone who wants to add more dataset for the project.
Feel free to use content of this repo for your use.
Thanks.
